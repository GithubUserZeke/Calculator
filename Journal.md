 5. git is a tool. Git is used for code versioning. Keeping track of the code.
 can check status by typing git status. Can track changes by using Git add .(everything in directory) or use file name.
 6. in VSC to bring up the terminal i can use the command (ctrl+`) 
 and changes made in VSC i would have to save-go to source control-stage changes-write a message-then commit/push. then go to github refresh page to see changes.
